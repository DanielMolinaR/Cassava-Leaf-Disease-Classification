# Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification
We are going to develop different CNNs to classify the images from [Cassava Leaf Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/overview) repositoy in kaggle. We are going to use pretrained CNNs applying tasks like transfer learning and fine-tuning. After that we will develop our own CNN. For both process we will apply regularization techniques.
